# HamLog.
HamLog was officially released on March 10, 2018. It is my first project to use <a href="https://electronjs.org">Electron</a>. 
<p>HamLog makes it easy to log ham radio contacts.</p>
<p>HamLog is only available for MacOS. You may be able to run it on Windows or Linux, but I cannot gaurentee this will work. See Download ยง Develope & Windows / Linux</p>
